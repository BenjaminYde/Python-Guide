    "#### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Check**: When the consumer() function is called, it first acquires the condition lock (because of the with condition: statement).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Waiting for the Condition**:\n",
    "    - The `if not item_available`: check is used to determine if the item is available for consumption.\n",
    "    - If `item_available` is `False` (meaning the item is not available), the consumer calls condition.wait(). This does two things:\n",
    "      - Releases the lock temporarily. This allows other threads (like the producer) to acquire the lock and change the state (i.e., produce an item).\n",
    "      - Blocks (waits) until `condition.notify()` or `condition.notify_all()` is called by another thread (the producer in this case).\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Resuming After Notification**:\n",
    "   - Once the producer calls `condition.notify()`, the consumer is awakened (unblocked) and re-acquires the lock.\n",
    "   - After re-acquiring the lock, it proceeds to the next line and completes its execution."
