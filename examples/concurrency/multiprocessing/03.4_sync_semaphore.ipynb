    "**Semaphore**: We create a Semaphore with a value of 2, which means only two processes can access the shared resource at the same time.\n",

    "**Release of Semaphore**: Upon completing its work, each process automatically releases the semaphore (exiting the with semaphore: block), allowing another waiting process to access the resource."
